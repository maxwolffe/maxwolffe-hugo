# Hi, I'm Max

I'm currently a software engineer at Databricks, working. I previously worked at LinkedIn on the Realtime Messaging Platform. I'm passionate about teaching, learning, and building cool things. While at Berkeley I was an Undergraduate Student Instructor for [CS61A][cs61a], a Developer for [Cal Blueprint][blueprint], an Undergraduate Research Assistant with the [NetSys][netsys] lab, and the Director of Logistics for [TEDxBerkeley][tedxberkeley].

You can send me an email [here][max-email].

Thanks for visiting!
